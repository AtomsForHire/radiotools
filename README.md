# Radiotools

Just a small collection of tools I found myself using in my studies. Wanted to
do something not in Python for once, it was either C or Zig but I didn't want to
manage header files and Cmake.

# Installing

Will need Zig `0.15.2` installed on your system.

Run:

```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -p <somewhere in your PATH>
```
